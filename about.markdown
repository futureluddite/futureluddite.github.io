Hi! I'm Robert Rayborn.

I'm a 30-something freelancer, nerd, and data geek.

I currently live in Charlottesville although I spent the last decade in Sunnyvale, San Francisco, & Portland. Prior to that, I grew up in the suburbs north of Atlanta and went to the Georgia Instititute of Technology for my undergrad.

My personal interests include 3d printing & [design](https://www.thingiverse.com/future_luddite/designs), indoor climbing, gardening, canning, hiking, and home automation. In the future, I'd like to delve deeper into woodworking and home DIY CNC. I'm absolutely obsessed with my shepherd mixes Klaus and Maverick. I'm also supported by my loving and wonderful fiance Caitlin, who brought us to Charlottesville with her work. My (admittedly poor) taste in music occupies three main areas: jazz/disco/funk, early 2010s hip hop, and punk rock/ska.

Professionally, I have a unique skillset that is poorly defined by standard labels given my esoteric background. I love working with data, especially data that requires some optimization to extract/transform. My background at Google and Mozilla has given me the luxury of working with all kinds of interesting data sets. I would say that I have strong SQL/Excel/Visualisation/Reporting/Presentation skills, know enough stats for basic experiments/funnel analysis, and know enough coding from my undergrad/work to get things done in Python / webdev. My domain expertise has been in both quantitative user research (Mozilla) and Ads (Google).

I'm interested in roles in data pipelining, data visualization, experiment design/analysis, survey design/analysis. While there are many candidates who have deeper skills in many of these areas, I have a proven record of cross-disciplinary work and coordination.

Both professionally and personnally, I'm a big fan of good design and have very little patience for abusive or poorly implemented user experiences. I'd also like to see technology go in a more privacy and attention respecting direction, and take active steps in my personal life to accelerate that transition.
