Hi! I'm Robert Rayborn.

I'm a 30-something freelancer, nerd, and data geek.

I currently live in Charlottesville, but I spent the last decade in Sunnyvale, San Francisco, & Portland. Prior to that, I grew up in the suburbs north of Atlanta and went to the Georgia Instititute of Technology for my undergrad in Computer Science.

My personal interests include 3d printing & design, indoor climbing, gardening, cooking, hiking, and home automation. In the future, I'd like to delve deeper into woodworking and home DIY CNC. I'm absolutely obsessed with my shepherd mixes Klaus and Maverick. I'm supported by my loving and wonderful fiance Caitlin, who brought us to Charlottesville with her work. My (admittedly poor) taste in music occupies three main areas: jazz/disco/funk, early 2010s hip hop, and punk rock/ska.

Professionally, I have a unique skillset that is poorly defined by standard titles given my background. I love working with data, especially data that requires some optimization to extract/transform. My background at Google and Mozilla gave me the luxury of working with all kinds of interesting datasets. I have strong SQL/Excel/Visualisation/Reporting/Presentation skills, know enough stats for basic experiments/funnel analysis, and know enough coding to get things done in Python / webdev / SQL. My domain expertise has been in both quantitative user research (Mozilla) and Ads (Google).

I'm interested in roles in data pipelining, data visualization, experiment design/analysis, survey design/analysis. While there are many candidates who have deeper skills in one of these areas, I believe that my unique combination of skills sets me apart.

Both professionally and personnally, I'm a big fan of good design and have very little patience for abusive or poorly implemented user experiences. I'd also like to see technology go in a more privacy and attention respecting direction, and take active steps in my personal life to accelerate that transition.
