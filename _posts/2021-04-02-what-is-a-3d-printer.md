title: What is a 3d printer?
---

Based on the blog post title this may sound like a very well-covered question, but what I’d really like to cover is “What is the value proposition of a 3d printer to me?” (a much less catchy title).

While some buy 3d printers to make trinkets, to contribute to a specific hobby, or to simply nerd out, I don’t find those to be the strongest mass market value proposition. I would posit the following as my personal value proposition and a strong proposition to the average consumer.
“A 3d printer is a device to remove minor inconveniences from your life”.

You see, I’m one of those people who gets really annoyed by minor inconveniences, especially when they come from poor design and testing practices. Now-a-days instead of getting angry when I come across a new inconvenience, I instead search public designs to see if someone else has solved my problems, and if one is not available I’ll even attempt to design my own solution.

Some examples of this include the following:

* Want a low profile dog collar tag with the option for an AirTag for tracking? So did I, so I [designed one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4836922). My personal print includes a QR code with detailed info on each dog as well as phone numbers.
* You know those plastic bits you have around the house that have broken and severely limited the usability of your devices? Chances are they’ve already broken for someone else who has uploaded a solution. Some great personal examples of this are my [Kobalt toolbox’s terrible latches](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4163799) and my [Roku’s battery cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2246134).
* I love my click-clack-y HyperX mechanical keyboard (my fiance does not). However, I hate the maximum angle that the legs provide. Unfortunately, no one had solved this problem for me; however the [design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4739952) required to solve it myself took about a half hour and now the keyboard is at a more acceptable angle!
* Tired of using binder clips to get the most of your toothpaste? Print a [dedicated toothpaste squeezer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3136621).
* Bedroom too small for a bedside table? Print a [iPhone holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:760369) that hooks onto your bed frame and accepts a wireless charger!

While I love my 3d printer for many reasons including accelerating my hobbies and teaching me new skills, my favorite thing about it is that it prints mitigations to everyday annoyances.
